[The Portfolio of Charlie Quinn](http://charliequinn.ca/)

I live my life like a video game.
I believe that everything I design, love, and work for, will unlock an awesome achievement.
I’m constantly working towards the next level, but I’ve made a habit of going back to upgrade my skills and search for hidden treasures.

More than anything, I like finding new hats to wear (seriously, you should see [my collection!](http://charlie-quinn.github.io/portfolio/hat-collection.html)).
At times I’m a craftsman, at others an accountant, and often a pastry chef.

The design process can get a little crazy.
I love what I do for a living.
